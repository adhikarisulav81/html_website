In present context technology has become one of the most powerful weapon because technologies are implemented or applicable in various sectors. Even in the field of education also technology has been concerned as the mandatory tool for effective and systematic learning. Nowadays in each and every schools, colleges and universities there exhibts the use of computer, even the entire class are technically based, as the classes are organized or taught through the assist of computers and projectors. Besides this in several restaurants, robots are kept for serving the dishes to the customers.

Because of the development of technology, human beings have become so introvert and unfriendly with each other. For example; due to the invention of smartphones, nowadays everyone has their mobile phones in their hand and they are so busy in their phones that they lack in giving time to their families or friends. Those person who are far are brought close and those who are nearby are pretended to be far, in both cases technology is the prime source.</span></p>

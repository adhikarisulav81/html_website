For the purpose of implementation of card viewing design in blog section of webpage, we must know the syntax that it follows. Left side's screenshot views the particular webiste from which we took referenced.I used the card view concept to display the blog. I applied card vieing concept beacuse I find it interesting and standard. Card viewing helps in bindig the whole content. Right side screenshot is the blog section of my webpage consiting three card view section. Each card contains a read more button for spanning the text and the button also consist of a hover effect which I have taken reference from W3School site. </td></p>

I used the radio button for gender and a button for submitting the form. Moreover I used Java Script for displaying approprate message to the user during the process of filling the form. If any textfield are left empty then a favourable message is displayed and suggest to fill up the form again else thanking message is displayed.</td></p>
